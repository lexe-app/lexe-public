# This package provides the `ftxsgx-elf2sgxs` tool, which converts an ELF binary
# targetting `x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx` into a canonical `.sgxs` file. These
# `.sgxs` files are special, as they exactly mirror the memory layout of the
# enclave as it's initially loaded into memory and measured (hashed) by the SGX
# platform.
#
# That means we can literally run `sha256sum` on the `.sgxs` file and get the
# exact same enclave measurement as the SGX platform, without having to actually
# load the enclave.
