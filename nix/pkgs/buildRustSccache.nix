# A wrapper around `craneLib.buildPackage` but can use `sccache` to improve
# build times.
#
# `sccache` requires a persistent cache directory, which means giving the nix
# build sandbox access to this shared, global directory, `/var/cache/lexe`.
#
#
# ## Host cache directory setup:
#
# Follow the steps in <../../public/README.md#fast-incremental-cargo-builds-in-nix>.
#
#
# ## Why
#
# The original `rustBuildIncremental` actually produces bad output in some
# cases.
#
# (1) it purely relies on `cargo` incremental build correctness.
# (2) nix flakes copies the repo source to the /nix/store.
# (3) for reproducibility, everything in /nix/store has mtime == 1970-01-01.
# (4) cargo's rebuild checking only rebuilds if file.mtime > cache.mtime,
#     so we get false negatives (cargo believes the file is unchanged when
#     it is actually different).
#
# Relevant issue:
# [cargo - fingerprint by hash instead of mtime](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6529)
#
#
# ## Introducing sccache
#
# `sccache` caches individual `rustc` invocations and stores the results
# in `$SCCACHE_DIR = /var/cache/lexe/sccache`. Using `sccache`:
#
# - cached builds are about 0.4-0.5x time (faster)
# - uncached builds are about 1.1-1.2x time (extra overhead)
# - sccache sadly can't cache proc-macro crates...
#
#
# ## Shared build directory Explanation
#
# Here we setup a persistent, shared build directory, `/var/cache/lexe` with
# some special permissions. The main idea here is that we want all users in the
# `nixbld` group to be able to effortlessly manipulate files in the shared
# directory without locking any files to a specific user.
#
# For security, we only allow `nixbld` users to access the shared directory
# (though truthfully, anyone with `nix daemon` access could probably figure out
# how to poison the shared build cache...)
#
# We specify '2' in the 2770 modifier to enable the SETGID bit. SETGID on a
# directory like this will _propagate_ the `nixbld` group to all newly created
# files/dirs in the shared build dir.
#
# We also set a default file ACL which makes all newly created files/dirs have
# group r/w/x permissions. That way, even if we run multiple concurrent
# `nix build` commands, they will correctly serialize access to the shared dir
# (cargo has its build locking system) and produce files that are
# read/write/exec-able by all other `nixbld` users.
