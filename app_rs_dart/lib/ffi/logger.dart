/// Init the Rust [`tracing`] logger. Also sets the current `RUST_LOG_TX`
/// instance, which ships Rust logs over to the dart side for printing.
///
/// Since `println!`/stdout gets swallowed on mobile, we ship log messages over
/// to dart for printing. Otherwise we can't see logs while developing.
///
/// When dart calls this function, it generates a `log_tx` and `log_rx`, then
/// sends the `log_tx` to Rust while holding on to the `log_rx`. When Rust gets
/// a new [`tracing`] log event, it enqueues the formatted log onto the
/// `log_tx`.
///
/// Unlike our other Rust loggers, this init will _not_ panic if a
/// logger instance is already set. Instead it will just update the
/// `RUST_LOG_TX`. This funky setup allows us to seamlessly support flutter's
/// hot restart, which would otherwise try to re-init the logger (and cause a
/// panic) but we still need to register a new log tx.
///
/// `rust_log`: since env vars don't work well on mobile, we need to ship the
/// equivalent of `$RUST_LOG` configured at build-time through here.
