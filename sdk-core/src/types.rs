//! This module contains common data structures and types used by API request
//! and response types.
//!
//! NOTE: The guidelines in [`sdk_core::models`] should also be followed here:
//!
//! - Simple: minimal nesting, fewer fields
//! - User-facing docs
//! - Document serialization and units
//! - Serialize `null`
