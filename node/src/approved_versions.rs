//! Node version approval and revocation. The purpose of this module is to
//! implement a revocation system which prevents Lexe from running old versions
//! which are no longer approved by the user, or which may be vulnerable.
//! This node version approval and revocation system relies on the rollback
//! protection provided by the user's 3rd party cloud.

/// The set of versions which are currently approved to run.
/// Contains up to [`MAX_SIZE`] approved versions.
///
/// - *Approval*: When a node version is provisioned, its semver version and
///   measurement are added to the [`approved`] list, if it didn't exist. If the
///   [`ApprovedVersions`] was updated, it is E2E-encrypted and (re)persisted to
///   the user's 3rd party cloud.
/// - *Rolling revocations*: If adding the provisioned node version results in
///   the [`approved`] list having greater than [`MAX_SIZE`] entries, the
///   version(s) which are no longer in the [`MAX_SIZE`] newest versions
///   according to semver precedence are removed from the list (revoked). So
///   Lexe knows not to schedule this version, the corresponding sealed seed is
///   also deleted from Lexe's DB (although the user has no way to verify this).
/// - *Enforcement*: At user node runtime, the [`ApprovedVersions`] is fetched
///   from the 3rd party cloud. If the current version and measurement is not
///   contained in the [`approved`] list, or if the list is not found at all,
///   the user node shuts itself down.
/// - *Yanking*: If there is a vulnerability or critical error discovered in
///   some release, it is added to [`YANKED_NODE_VERSIONS`] and
///   [`YANKED_NODE_MEASUREMENTS`]. The next user node release will contain the
///   updated consts. When the user provisions to the new node release, anything
///   in [`approved`] which is also contained inside these consts is removed.
///   For safety, Lexe, who always has access to the up-to-date consts, will
///   also not schedule versions which are found in these consts.
