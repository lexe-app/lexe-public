# - Be sure to use the specific patched versions.
# - See the workspace Cargo.toml for patch declarations.
# - The versions for transitive dependencies (such as hyper, mio, ring, etc) are
#   declared in `common`'s Cargo.toml and propagated to other crates by
#   workspace-level dependency resolution.
