# When true, return panics w/ backtraces to the host via the shared "debug
# buffer". We need this to debug panics in prod. rust-std also currently saves
# some registers so a debugger can reconstruct the stack.
# NOTE: this is not the same as the SGX platform DEBUG mode, which disables all
# memory protections.
# TODO(phlip9): patch rust-std so it always saves panics w/ backtraces but only
# dumps registers if `debug = true`.
