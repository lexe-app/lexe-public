//! # Rust/Dart FFI bindings
//!
//! This file contains all types and functions exposed to Dart. All `pub`
//! functions, structs, and enums in this file also have corresponding
//! representations in the generated Dart code.
//!
//! The generated Dart interface lives in
//! `../../app/lib/bindings_generated_api.dart` (definitions) and
//! `../../app/lib/bindings_generated.dart` (impls).
//!
//! The low-level generated Rust C-ABI interface is in
//! [`crate::bindings_generated`].
//!
//! These FFI bindings are generated using the `app-rs-codegen` crate. Be sure
//! to re-run the `app-rs-codegen` whenever this file changes.
//!
//! ## Understanding the codegen
//!
//! * Both platforms have different representations for most common types like
//!   usize and String.
//! * Basic types are copied to the native platform representation when crossing
//!   the FFI boundary.
//! * For example strings are necessarily copied, as Rust uses utf-8 encoded
//!   strings while Dart uses utf-16 encoded strings.
//! * There are a few special cases where we can avoid copying, like returning a
//!   `ZeroCopyBuffer<Vec<u8>>` from Rust, which becomes a `Uint8List` on the
//!   Dart side without a copy, since Rust can prove there are no borrows to the
//!   owned buffer when it's transferred.
//! * Normal looking pub functions, like `pub fn foo() -> u32 { 123 }` look like
//!   async fn's on the Dart side and are run on a separate small threadpool on
//!   the Rust side to avoid blocking the main Flutter UI isolate.
//! * Functions that return `SyncReturn<_>` do block the calling Dart isolate
//!   and are run in-place on that isolate.
//! * `SyncReturn` has ~10x less overhead. Think a few 50-100 ns vs a few Âµs
//!   overhead per call.
//! * We have to be careful about blocking the main UI isolate, since we only
//!   have 16 ms frame budget to compute and render the UI to maintain a smooth
//!   60 fps. Any ffi that runs for longer than maybe 1 ms should definitely run
//!   as a separate task on the threadpool. Just reading a value out of some
//!   in-memory state is probably cheaper overall to use `SyncReturn`.
