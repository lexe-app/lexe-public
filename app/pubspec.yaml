# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
#
# A version number is <build-name>+<build-code>, where <build-name> is like
# `1.2.3` and <build-code> is like `45`.
#
# In Android, <build-name> is used as `versionName` while <build-number> used as
# `versionCode`. Read more about Android versioning at
# <https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning>.
#
# In iOS, <build-name> is used as `CFBundleShortVersionString` while
# <build-number> is used as `CFBundleVersion`. Read more about iOS versioning at
# <https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html>
#
# In Windows, <build-name> is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while <build-number> is used as the build suffix.

  # Until the UI/design stabilizes, I've decided to use
  # [variable fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide).
  #
  # These variable fonts combine all the different styles and variations
  # (normal vs italic, font weights, font slant, optical sizing, etc...) in one
  # file, which is convenient while the UI is still in flux.
  #
  # When we go to launch, we could probably shave off ~1.5 MiB from the app size
  # by only shipping the exact, static font variantions that we ultimately use.
