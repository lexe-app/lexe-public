# Integration Test Drivers

This directory contains driver files for Flutter integration tests.

## `integration_driver.dart`

Simple driver file required by Flutter's `flutter drive` command for running
integration tests.
Used by the documentation screenshot automation system.

See `../integration_test/design_screenshots_test.dart` for the actual test that
generates documentation screenshots.
